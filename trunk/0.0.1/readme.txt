Q. On which devices can I read out loud?
A. It can be used with Google Chrome, Edge, and Firefox for PCs, and with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Firefox for smartphones, respectively. We are not sure about Mac and iOS, as the developer does not own them, but they are probably fine. We would be grateful for your reports on how it works.
